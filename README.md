# [Big–ò–¥–µ—è](https://bigidea.edu.kg)

### Features

- Advanced sign-up / log-in (sending authtoken and resetting password by link through email)
- Advanced post customizing
- Admin panel

### Learned / Practiced

- OOP, PDO, composer, MVC
- Hosting (buying domain, Filezila (FTP), Email-domain)
- SQL Queries
- Sending Email (PHP Mailer)

### Notes

- Please note that this project may NOT meet good practices for MVC development (All models, except user/categorie/hashtag models are stored within the post model, violating the SRP; no distinct View or MainController), as it was made for practice purposes.
